#Length of Names
The length of field and method names, field and method descriptors, and other constant string values (including those referenced by ConstantValue (ยง4.7.2) attributes) is limited to **65535 characters** by the 16-bit unsigned length item of the CONSTANT_Utf8_info structure (ยง4.4.7).

> Note that the limit is on the number of bytes in the encoding and not on the number of encoded characters. UTF-8 encodes some characters using two or three bytes. Thus, strings incorporating multibyte characters are further constrained.
