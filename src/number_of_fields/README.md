#Number of Fields

The number of fields that may be declared by a class or interface is limited to **65535 by the size** of the fields_count item of the ClassFile structure (§4.1).

> Note that the value of the fields_count item of the ClassFile structure does not include fields that are inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces.
